| Basic IPAdapter        | [openart.ai](https://openart.ai/workflows/openart/-/8H0mGG5dOFQCuslp2qQv)      || ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/2.png) |<div align="justify">  The [workflow](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-basic-ipadapter-8H0mGG5dOFQCuslp2qQv-openart-openart.ai.json) has more of artistic feature, and the style is similar to most of the workflows using IPAdapter modules, which are mostly used to process comic pictures.</div><br>Other IPAdapter Workflows:<br> - [IPAdaptor Impainting](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-ipadapter-inpainting-SwnT5jEA2mQ9l76l4oTi-openart-openart.ai.json) <br> - [IPAdapter Batches](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-ipadapter-batches-uxH7XEmMuKTAC0sfr8s1-openart-openart.ai.json) <br> - [IPAdapter Face](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-ipadapter-face-XawUsrzeX2ost6XiVtNP-openart-openart.ai.json) <br> - [IPAdapter Masking](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-ipadapter-masking-pz0rXAidFCTK2EEmUB1X-openart-openart.ai.json) | 3           |
| SD3 Animation V1.1        | [openart.ai](https://openart.ai/workflows/aigc101/sd3-animation-v11/OkmDjEtUlNmjdRx0Nqpx)      || ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/3.png) |<div align="justify">  The [workflow](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-sd3-animation-v11-OkmDjEtUlNmjdRx0Nqpx-aigc101-openart.ai.json) is designed to reinforce the performance of the SD 3 model, it is notable that the generated videos can contain readable text. However, the workflow is a lot more complicate, and the generating speed is seemingly slower. </div>| 1.5          |
| Any character Any Pose       | [openart.ai](https://openart.ai/workflows/amadeusxr/any-character-any-pose/2Thak4NM7a72KOKYyLJA)      || ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/4.png) |<div align="justify">  The [workflow](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-any-character-any-pose-2Thak4NM7a72KOKYyLJA-amadeusxr-openart.ai.json) requires users to draw a sketch of the skeleton that defines the post of the character we want to generate. The process can be fun to play with, although we should try to sketch the pose as accurate as possible. Sometimes the created post can be unrealistic, and the negative prompt is suggested to avoid unnatural posture. </div>| 1         |
| Change Background ++      | [openart.ai](https://openart.ai/workflows/grinlau/change-background/DoiYOkLj6ikwIbygd4gY)      || ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/5.1.png) ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/5.2.png) |<div align="justify">  The [workflow](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-change-background-DoiYOkLj6ikwIbygd4gY-grinlau-openart.ai.json) is one of the most powerful one that can realize the changing of backgrounds of pictures with extremely high accuracy. The workflow is tremendously complex and customizable. However, there are some details to pay attention to when using this workflow. </div> <br> * There are tons of nodes to be installed to use this workflow, and errors will occur if the nodes are not exactly the same as the ones it requires. <br> * There are minor unavoidable adjustments on the unchanged part of the picture before and after changing the background that causes inconsistency in aspects like tone, brightness or style.| 3          |
| Zero123 + Animatediff V3       | [openart.ai](https://openart.ai/workflows/rui400/zero123-animatediff-v3/k2nrE5EAsFWUVvDmYerC)      || ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/6.png) |<div align="justify">  The [workflow](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-zero123-animatediff-v3-k2nrE5EAsFWUVvDmYerC-rui400-openart.ai.json) leverages Zero123 with the AnimateDiffV3 model to create superior angle rotation animations. Its efficient loading results in higher quality. Zero123 handles angle inference, producing 32 frames for a full rotation, adjustable based on GPU capacity. The workflow is quite easy to use and the generation speed is relatively fast considering a batch of pictures is generated; however, it should be noted that some nodes have descriptions of Chinese </div>| 1          |
| Easy Product Relight      | [openart.ai](https://openart.ai/workflows/alansyn/easy-product-relight/XdzTNRbqi1kMYpNjuFWm)      || ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/7.1.png) ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/7.2.png) |<div align="justify">  The [workflow](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-easy-product-relight-XdzTNRbqi1kMYpNjuFWm-alansyn-openart.ai.json) is similar to the background changing one. However, the model is more advanced for objects like products rather than living creatures. The tone of the objects will also be modified to fit in the style of the background. It is suggested to not use object with text as sometimes the text has a chance to be deformed after transformation. </div>| 1.5          |

The workflow is quite easy to use and the generation speed is relatively high. Overall the features are easy but highly useful. </div>| 0.5          |
| Style Logo Animation       | [openart.ai](https://openart.ai/workflows/fish_intent_33/style-logo-animation/fgIYpCekyLG7xHco0uBF)      || ![Image](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/9.png) |<div align="justify">  The [workflow](https://github.com/Bzin68/Nodes_Library/blob/main/workflow-style-logo-animation-fgIYpCekyLG7xHco0uBF-fish_intent_33-openart.ai.json) has complex functions. To ensure the generation quality, the GPU capability should be as high as possible. The speed of generation is slow; however, the results can be amazing if the device is advanced and the usage is proper. </div>| 2.5         |
